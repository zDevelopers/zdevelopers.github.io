We've been making Minecraft plugins for [a ten-years-old old French community](https://zcraft.fr). Over time, we
accumulated projects, and tools to create them easily.

Everything we created is published under an open-source licence, usually CeCILL-B (BSD-style in French law), and totally
**free to use**.

# Bukkit Plugins

## ImageOnMap

ImageOnMap is a Bukkit plugin made to allow players to display any image (in PNG, JPEG or GIF format) directly in game,
allowing to enhance their builds and add unique assets to them!

## Hawk

Hawk is a game report system, typically for competitive Minecraft game, but it is very flexible and adapts to a wide
range of uses. Run a command on your server; then, like a hawk, it'll track everything players do and generate on-demand
a **beautiful web report**. Give  the link to the players, so they can see how they performed and share their game with
their friends!

A [real-life game report](https://hawk.carrade.eu/65m7j2x6) is available, if you want to see what it's like. We provide
hosting, but you can host a web instance if you prefer to.

Hawk is also available for developers to integrate into their plugins (see below).


# Libraries for developers

To share code between plugins, we created some libraries for Bukkit plugins development. These libraries are open to
anyone, and are meant to speed up Minecraft plugins development by implementing common systems or utilities.

## QuartzLib

Formerly zLib, this is our biggest library, by far. Inside, you'll fine components to handle common Minecraft plugins
patterns, like:

- powerful and typed configuration module;
- easier to use commands module;
- simple tools to display rich texts or GUIs;
- natural NBT read and write;
- internationalization;
- scoreboards;
- workers, for any background tasks your plugin may need;
- and lots more.

You'll get each one of these features **without having to ask your users to install a separate lib plugin**, thanks to
the magic of Maven shading. Also, only the parts you actually use remain in your plugin JAR at the end, even if
QuartzLib as a whole is quite huge.

## QuartzTeams

This way smaller library handles teams in games. We use it for our game plugins, like Quartz Survival Games or Balls of
Steel. It allows you to:

- create and manage teams and their properties;
- offer pre-built GUIs and commands for players to create (if you allow them to) or join teams.

## Hawk

Hawk is a game report system, typically for competitive Minecraft game, but it is very flexible and adapts to a wide
range of uses. Run a command on your servr or integrate it to your game plugin with a few lines of code; then, like a
hawk, it'll track everything players do and generate on-demand a beautiful web report. Give  the link to the players, so
they can see how they performed and share their game with their friends!

You can also add to it special events that may happen during your game.

A [real-life game report](https://hawk.carrade.eu/65m7j2x6) is available, if you want to see what it's like. We provide
hosting, but you can host a web instance if you prefer to.

## Sentry Bukkit

Sentry-Bukkit is a library to automatically collect crashes and exceptions to a [Sentry](https://sentry.io) project, as
well as collecting user feedback from a provided or self-hosted web interface.

_Coming soon._
