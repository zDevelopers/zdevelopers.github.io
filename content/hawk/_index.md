Hawk is a game report system, typically for competitive Minecraft game, but it is very flexible and adapts to a wide range of uses. Run a command on your server or integrate it to your game plugin with a few lines of code; then, like a hawk, it'll track everything players do and generate on-demand a beautiful web report. Give  the link to the players, so they can see how they performed and share their game with their friends!

You can also add to it special events that may happen during your game.

A [real-life game report](https://hawk.carrade.eu/ZP5Gt2l4) is available, if you want to see what it's like. We provide hosting but you can host a web instance if you prefer to.

Hawk is available in two flavours:

- one for **server owners** who want to record their games without headache: it's a small plugin to install;
- one for **Bukkit plugins developers** who want to automatically generate reports for the games they are creating with a very simple API.
